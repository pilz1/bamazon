1. Setup Database
	- open up mySQL start a new databse then create it, use the database you just created and structure with a databse table. In that table assign names to the columns according to the item_id, product_name, department_name, price, stock_quantity.

2. Create Node App
	- Open up tthe terminal and downlaod the npm packages for SQL and inquirer once that is done create a bamazon.js file in which you will link th node npm packages and this is where you will do the functions that assign the messages that will prompt on the terminal.

3. User experience
	- If everything is programmed correctly the app should work like an online store in which the user puts in the name of the item and then the databse checks it's availabiity and then preps the customer for checkout with the price of the item they have chosen. 

4. Manager View
	- Make a manager menu option to help management deal with inventory and be able to keep a log of customers and proucts for future reference this could be done in the same way that you made the user experience but instead have all the prompts to a new node app which can only be seen by managemnt and have the ability to participate in all that's happening in the online store.
